# Assignment Instruction

In this assignment, you will play and tweak with Galaxy workflows as both a user and a developer. This is a group assignment with a maximum of 2 students in each group.

In the first part of the assignment, you will run a Galaxy workflow as the end users by importing the workflows and tweaking the parameters; in the second part, you became developers and administrators of Galaxy: you will develop a new Galaxy tool, install and modify another tool and create a workflow. After finishing this assignment, you will be familiar with Galaxy from different perspectives.

## Before starting your assignment

### Make a team

You need to form your team by enrolling a group on [Blackboard](https:://bb.vu.nl).

### Get the access to a Galaxy instance on the cloud

There are two Galaxy instances running on the cloud. Please click here to sign up one of the instances for your team (each team has one account will suffice).

### Prepare Docker and stuff

Please refer to [this](https://github.com/ibivu/B4TM-Galaxy-2017/tree/master/docker), which will handhold you through the preparation.

### **Issues and discussion**

Outside the practicals, you may submit your issues via [Github](https://github.com/ibivu/B4TM-Galaxy-2017/issues) and we will reply to you as soon as possible. To expedite the solution, everybody is encouraged to join the discussion in [Github](https://github.com/ibivu/B4TM-Galaxy-2017/issues), so that many of the questions may have been answered before we reply.

## **Part 1**: run a workflow in Galaxy

### Setup

Please create a user account in your Galaxy instance on the cloud. Each team has one account. Due to the expensive computation of the workflow and the limited cloud computation resources, each team should run one workflow collectively rather than individually.

### To-do list
In this part, you are required to:
1. import the workflow from the given Galaxy workflow file.
2. run this workflow on the dataset given, using the parameters =0.5, =0.3, and FDR from  (May et al. 2016)
3. visualise the output of workflow.

It may take more than 24 hours to run this workflow.

For this part, you need to hand in:
1. A screenshot of the workflow.
2. A visualisation of the workflow output.
