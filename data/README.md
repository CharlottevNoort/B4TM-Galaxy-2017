# Instruction

This folder contains all the input datasets you need to run the workflow.

`edges.txt` is contains the edges that will be used as the input of Heinz (the tool at the end of the workflow). The rest are the datasets of dental caries (DC), which consist of supragingival plague samples from 36 individuals who had either a caries-positive (CP) or caries-negative (CN) oral health profile.

For more details of these datasets, please refer
to [[1]](https://github.com/ibivu/B4TM-Galaxy-2017/blob/master/papers/metaModules.pdf).

## Build a dataset list
In Galaxy, multiple files can be organized into a single dataset list, which
can be used as the single input for some Galaxy tools. In this assignment, you
probably need this.
