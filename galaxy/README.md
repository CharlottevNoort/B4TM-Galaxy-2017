# Galaxy Server

For the first part of the assignment, each group needs to access one of the servers below. Each server has 12 CPUs 
and 80 GB memory. Due to the limited computation resources, each group can only run one job (the whole workflow with the full
dataset). To avoid overusing one server, please register your choice of server
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12e9CAzYub5QLkYW4qgIcHdmjoOCxbMV2qCYNDjLpwwE/edit?usp=sharing).
