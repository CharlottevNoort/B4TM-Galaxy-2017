# Use guide

This directory stores all the scripts and files you will use in this assignment.

## deseq2.R

In the official version of DESeq2 Galaxy tool, filtering the low-quality KOs by 'baseMean' is not supported, which however is
required in metaModule. Therefore, we provide a bespoke version to enable this function.

## graphviz.py

You may use this Python script to visualise the output of Heinz (the final output of the workflow). This script can only run
in Python 3.5+ and you need to solve the Python package dependencies. Alternatively, you can look for your own solution to
visualise the Heinz output.

## workflow.ga

The workflow file you need in the first part of the assignment.
